<p>I got word today that my hair stylist is closing down, and moving to Vienna. So I should get an appointment soon, to get a last cut and have him recommend an other place to go to.  This sounds like boring trivia, but I doubt I'll find another barber who can cut hair, has good music, his kids and a bunch of weirdo friends hanging out at his shop <strong>and</strong> who occasionally stops working,  as to explain a movie more vividly.</p>
