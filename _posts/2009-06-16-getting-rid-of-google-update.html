<p><strong>Important note:</strong> If you use Chrome, and you follow these instructions you will prevent Chrome from automatically updating. Given the state of the Internet, <strong>you don't want to do that</strong>. </p>
<p>I wanted to use Google Earth again, after a while and accidentally installed a new version. Unfortunately, Google had this bright idea of forcing you to install a permanent background task (as root) for it's "update engine". That is for a software that I use like 1 time a year.</p>
<p>Luckily, someone already posted on how to <a href="http://blog.raamdev.com/2008/12/19/howto-remove-google-software-update-on-mac-os-x">weed out this crap</a>, and prevent Google Earth from ever reinstalling it...</p>
