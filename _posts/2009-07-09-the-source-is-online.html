<p>Last week, rather quietly, we put the <a href="http://www.nietzschesource.org/">NietzscheSource</a> site online.  While we're still don't use all the cool features we built into the backend, and need to fight of some teething problems, you can finally see some philosophical content from the Discovery project. </p>
