<p>
C++ and other languages offer you the possibility to leave a loop by a 'break' statement. But should you do?</p>
<p>
In my opinion, you should not. A break statement is a back door of a loop. The execution of the program steals away through this back door. As in real life, the problem with someone stealing away is that you do not notice that he has gone.</p>
