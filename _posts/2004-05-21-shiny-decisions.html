Although my old glasses are quite cool, I decided that I could get a new pair. Unfortunately, new frames are expensive (at least if you want a decent style), and the lenses aren't even included. Thus, I haven't really decided yet.

But here's the fun part: You can help me with the decision. As you can see, I've already narrowed the choice to two models:<br />
<a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org/pictures/blog_pics/glasses_a.png">Model A</a> and <a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org/pictures/blog_pics/glasses_b2.png">Model B</a>.  You can click on the pictures to get a larger version (~1MB).

Go ahead and comment on the choices. Don't be shy, and try to be a little creative. Don't just say "A" or "B" - that would be boring, wouldn't it?
