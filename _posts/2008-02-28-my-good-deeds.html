<p>Today I learned something new about the Italian tax system: You can actually decide where a (very, very small) part of your taxes actually goes. There's 0,8% that goes to a church of your choice, or optionally to the state (for public welfare or something). </p>
<p>And 0,5% goes to an organisation of your choice (welfare, emergency relief, this type of thing).</p>
