<p>Just saw a link to a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7094695.stm">BBC article</a> that deals with the dear old <a href="http://laptop.org/">OLPC initiative</a>. Interesting to see how the people involved seem to lash out against "naysayers" and "politicians who don't think big". Let's quote one of those:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr Igwe Aja-Nwachuku said: "What is the sense of introducing One Laptop per Child when they don't have seats to sit down and learn; when they don't have uniforms to go to school in, where they don't have facilities?"</p>
<p>"We are more interested in laying a very solid foundation for quality education which will be efficient, effective, accessible and affordable."</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I don't know the guy's agenda in this case, but that statement sound very sensible to me. I also wonder why they call it "charity" when you sell somthing for prices that cover your cost...</p>
