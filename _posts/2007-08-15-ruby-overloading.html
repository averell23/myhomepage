<p>A new thing on my quest to learn the new language is weird inconsistency that bugged me lately: In Ruby you can overload virtually everything. That is, everything except the "equals" operator.</p>
<p>In spite of this, half of the Rubyists seem to believe that they overload the "equals" sign all the time. </p>
<p>Still, if you have this kind of expression: </p>
<blockquote><p>variable_1 = variable_2</p></blockquote>
<p>it will assign the value of variable_2 to variable_1, and there's no way to change this behaviour.</p>
<p>However, if have something that looks like this</p>
<blockquote><p>object.method = expression</p></blockquote>
<p>the code will actually be evaluated equivalent to</p>
<blockquote><p>object.send("method=", expression)</p></blockquote>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Yes, that's true: The expression above will actually call a method called "method=" with the value left of the "equals" sign as a parameter.</p>
<p>The nice point is that you can at least write a logic for "method assignments".</p>
<p>Not so nice is the fact that there's still no way to overload "equals", and that these method assignments work completely different than "normal" operator overloading.</p>
<p>Which means that if you call</p>
<blockquote><p>object.method + expression</p></blockquote>
<p>Ruby will first evaluate object.method and <strong>then</strong> call the "+" method on the object that was returned from the first call.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the call</p>
<blockquote><p>object.method = expression</p></blockquote>
<p>will call the "method=" method <strong>on object</strong> and return it's result. And "method=" is completely unrelated to "method".</p>
<p>Even worse, if you call</p>
<blockquote><p>object.method += expression</p></blockquote>
<p>this will evaluate "object.method", <strong>then</strong> call the "+" method on the object that was returned by this call. <strong>Then</strong> it will call "method=", giving the reference to the object from the previous step as a parameter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
x = object.method<br />
object.method=(x+expression)
</p></blockquote>
