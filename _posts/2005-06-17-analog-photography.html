<a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/digital-cameras/kodak/kodak-stops-production-of-bw-paper-108152.php">Gizmodo has it</a> that <a href="http://209.11.49.170/pdn/prodtech/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000962967">Kodak stops manufacturing B&amp;W paper</a>.
</div>
<div>And of course they claim that digital is the wave of the future, that nobody develops on B&amp;W anymore, and that only "college students taking pictures of bikes in puddles" are going to miss it.

Granted, digital <b>is</b> the wave of the future. I'll be going a digital SLR anytime soon - but I'd still be developing on B&amp;W, if I had the time. I also own  <a href="http://www.mido.ch/">a watch</a> that doesn't contain a single electronical component.

The fact is, people <i>like</i> mechanical and "handmade" things excatly because so much plastic-thrashy-indefinitely-copyabel-digital stuff out there. They crave for something <i>real</i>.

<div>
Granted, I'm biased because I'm one of the elite few still into B&amp;W. But consider this: Almost everyone I know owns a digicam. At each social event, enough pictures are taken to spam your friends until hell froze over thrice. Still, I can't remember that one of these digital pictures has ever been printed and put up on a wall.
