Well, it's been somewhat quiet here recently. It's not that there haven't been many stories lately. But, as <a href="http://www.chocolatemussolini.com/">Jenni</a> once put it: They're my stories, not yours.  Suffice to say that there's a girl in my life now.

Furthermore I'm still in the process of finding myself a job - if you happen to need a qualified software engineer, give me a call.

There's some more news on the <a href="http://www.seniorentanztee.de">Seniorentanztee</a> too: Thanks to Elin, the next event will be on the 30th of October - in Stockholm. There will also be the usual Schlonz at the <a href="http://www.akk.org/">AKK</a> on the 9th of December.
