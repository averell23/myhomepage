<p>When I bought some <a href="http://www.newgods.org/~averell/content/news/archives/000046.shtml">fancy new clothes</a> lately, people started asking: "Were'd you get this?" Then I realized that everybody and their grandmothers can get the same shirts as I.</p>
<div>
The fact is that, since the industrial revolution, almost everything we get is mass-produced. This isn't neccessarily bad, but there still seems to be a need for the unique and special.

There's a certain satisfaction in having items, especially clothes, which nobody else can get. Second-hand also lives off this fascination: "Classics" are often mass-products which are out of fashion (or out of production), and therefore scarce. My <a href="http://www.hfg-karlsruhe.de/~aboebel/ehrenwert/reccomfortbags/COMFORTSILBER.HTM">new bag</a> from <a href="http://www.ehrenwert.com">ehrenwert.com</a> is great, partly because it's from a small workshop that most people haven't even heard about. It gives you an elitist feeling. A <a href="http://www.freitag.ch">Freitag</a> bag, for example, would not only haven been thrice as expensive, but everyone has one already. How boring is that?

<div>
My most special personal possession are probably my bed, which has been custom-made for my size (and wasn't even expensive) and some pyjamas made by my mother. The latter are, let's say, rather playfully ornamented. I only ever wear them when I'm sick. But they're still cool in that nobody else has pyjamas like that.
