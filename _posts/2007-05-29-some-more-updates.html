<p>All right, here's another little update. I've actually been quite busy, with some adminstrational stuff to do, and lot's of travelling.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I went to <a href="http://www.weinchen.de/hochzeit_luel/index.html">Elin's and Ludwig's wedding</a> in Stockholm, which was a nice, relaxing weekend in the north. I also went to Bucharest last week for a project workshop. Unfortunately, I didn't have much opportunity to go out in the city.</p>
<p>Next week, I'll be in Trento again, and then visit a conference in Innsbruck. It seems my suitcase gets used quite a lot a the moment.</p>
<p>The Italian is also coming along slowly. I'm still not quite the conversationist, but at least I can go to a shop and buy things ;-)</p>
<p>Finally, the weather used to be very hot here, but at the moment some cold front moving through, with some thunderstorms, rain, and more bearable temperatures.</p>
