<p>Dancing class started again tonight. Based on that experience, I decided to publish some geekoid fashion tips by your half-uncool host.  It seems that this topic <a href="http://www.newgods.org/~averell/content/news/archives/000046.shtml#more">has been hot recently</a>.<br />

<ul>
<li>T-Shirts  issued by your sports club should be used for sports. Only.
</li>
<li>Chequered shirts: This cliche is so old that I don't even know where to start. For some reason, they never die out.</li>
<li>Avoid shirts that come in triple-packs.</li>
<li>No cartoons on socks.</li>
<li>T-Shirts with mathematical symbols, greek letters or program code  should <b>not</b> be worn in public.</li>
<li>If it is washed out, get a new one.</li>
<li>Do not wear white T-Shirts on pale skin.</li>
<li>Glasses: Prescription frames are not recommended. If you can't get something fashionable, get contact lenses. </li>
<li>Sun glasses should be worn in the sun. <b>Never</b> use them because you think they make you look cooler.</li>
<li>Consider getting a professional haircut.
</li>
</ul>
