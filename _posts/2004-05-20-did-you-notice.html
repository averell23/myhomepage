<p>Just for you information, this site has properly moved to <a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org/">http://www.limitedcreativity.org</a>. If you haven't noticed this so far, everything went as planned. </p>
<div>
Theoretically, the RSS feeds have new URLs now. There is a redirect from the old location, however, so you don't really need to bother to change anything. Have fun.
