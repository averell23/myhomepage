<p>I haven't changed my mind about <a title="Software is engineering" href="http://www.gewinnt-immer.de/?p=45">software development being an engineering task</a>.</p>
<p>However, after reading <a title="Refactoring and Manufactoring" href="http://www.lixo.org/archives/2005/12/12/on-ruby-refactoring-and-lean-manufacturing/">posts like this one</a>, I think I'm starting to get the idea of what bugged the other guys.</p>
<p>Here's the catch: Software development is <strong>not </strong>manufacturing.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is about creating lots and lots of copies of the same thing, using some blueprint and a predefined process.</p>
<p>Software development and other engineering disciplines are very different: They're about making the blueprints. Software is special in that the "blueprints" are the actual product. There's no manufacturing involved. Never ever.</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense to talk about software development in terms of manufacturing. And software processes which build on manufacturing processes are bound to fail. Once you think about it, that's pretty obvious.</p>
