<p>This site now features a nifty <a href="contact.shtml">contact form</a>, which can be used to send me a private message. This allows everyone to contact me, while protecting my email address from spammers.</p>
<div>
I also added the <a href="http://www.newgods.org/~averell/text.shtml?stockholm2003">travel log</a> for my trip to Stockholm. I didn't have the time to develop the photos from that trip, so it't just a blob of text so far.
