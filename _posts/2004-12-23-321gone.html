<div>
The countdown to christmas is almost over which means I'm just getting everything ready for the holidays. Christimas will be spent with the families, and for the new year Ingrid and me will fly off to London, visit my brother; and I'll be getting a small break from my new job.
</div>
<div>
And to all of you whom I haven't written christmas cards (which includes everyone...): I wish you a merry christmas (or happy holidays, or whatever you prefer) and a happy new year.
</div>
