I've just stumbled over a nice collection of <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/005353.html#005353">Lord Of The Rings pastiches</a> (pastiches? Just learned a cool new english word...), posted by Teresa Nielsen Hayden on <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/">Making Light</a>. You can also jump to the <a href="http://www.teemings.com/extras/lotr/index.html">complete archive</a>, but Teresa's post is more fun as it's a real guessing game. Don't forget to check the comments.

They seem to be a bit short on foreign authors, though. Anyone up for a Murakami adaption? A Thomas Mann version? Hesse would be cool, Marquez too.  James Joyce is already there (in case you forgot to celebrate <a href="http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com/">Bloomsday</a>).
