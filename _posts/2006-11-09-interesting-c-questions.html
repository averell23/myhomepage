<p>Actually, this one is a little quiz for you. I don't exactly know all the answers, but may you do ;-) These are some questions that highlight the differences between those garbage-collected languages where almost everything is a pointer-like reference, and the gritty world of C++.<br />
Assume you have a very simple C++ class like</p>
<blockquote><p>class MyPoint</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>double x;</p>
<p>double y;</p>
<p>MyPoint(const CMyPoint&amp; point) { ... }</p>
<p>MyPoint&amp; operator  = (const MyPoint&amp; param) { ... }</p>
<p>}</p></blockquote>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>and now you write a method that returns such a beast:</p>
<blockquote><p>MyPoint MakeSomePoint()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>MyPoint NewPoint;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>return NewPoint;</p>
<p>}</p></blockquote>
<p>Now you can call this method from somewhere else:</p>
<blockquote><p>...</p>
<p>MyPoint foobar = MakeSomePoint();</p>
<p>...</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, this kind of stuff really works. The assignment in the caller is still somewhat straightforward: A new object is created on the stack and the copy constructor is called with the result  of <strong>MakeSomePoint()</strong>. But the method creates the object on it's local stack, so why is it apparently still valid? Or is this only by accident?<br />
Further questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of thing does the <strong>MakeSomePoint()</strong> method return? Is it the exact same object that was created in the method body? Or a copy thereof? Or something else? And how's an object type passed (In contrast to pointers or references)?</li>
<li>What would be different if the method returned a reference instead?</li>
<li>At which point are the objects from <strong>MakeSomePoint()</strong>'s stack deleted?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy hunting!</p>
