<p>Today I found that our <a href="http://isas.uni-karlsruhe.de">institute's home page</a> contains a <a href="//isas.uni-karlsruhe.de/ka.mp4">TV feature on Karlsruhe</a>. It's something like school TV, and it's funny to have your own town explained like that. So if you want to know where I live, you can now see the movie. It's in german language, and I guess you should have a good connection.</p>
