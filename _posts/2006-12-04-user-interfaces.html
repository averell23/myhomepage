<p>Why does it seem to hard for web developers to get basic usability issues right? I've just been to another online booking system, which had those little calendar controls for setting the departure and return dates.</p>
<p>If you set the departure to next year, the return date remains nailed to next week. And if you send off the form, it will berate you for entering an impossible combination.<br />
Come on, it can't be so hard or expensive to come up with something that actually sets the return date to a sensible value automatically. That's what computers are for, after all.</p>
<p>But no, someone decided you should fiddle with those braindead controls forever. And after that, you'll have to enter your credit card number with exactly 16 numeric characters. No spaces, no dashes.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the 21st century, and you're not allowed to have space in your credit card number because the software doesn't allow for it. Back to the drawing board.</p>
