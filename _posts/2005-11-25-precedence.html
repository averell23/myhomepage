<p>Some of my colleagues seem to think that's a cool thing to avoid parens 'cause they know the C++ <a href="http://www.cppreference.com/operator_precedence.html">operator precedence list</a> by heart. Yuck. Would you know what <code>*foobar-&gt;function()</code> does, without looking it up? (Hint: It's not intuitive)</p>
<p>Just use that damn parens.</p>
