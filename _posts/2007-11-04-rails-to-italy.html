<p>Rails to Italy is done, and I think we did well. I already put <a href="http://www.talia.discovery-project.eu/?p=6">some stuff on our brand-new Talia blog</a>. Some guy also put on a (relatively well) <a href="http://blog.seesaw.it/articles/2007/10/29/railstoitaly-report">review of the conference</a>. He didn't say anything about my talk, though, so I guess he'd already left or my thing was remarkably unmemorable...</p>
<p>In any case, in my opinion these conferences are not so much about passing the concrete knowledge (which is hardly possible in a 20-minute presentation), but about bringing the community together and exchanging views.</p>
<p>There were a lot of fun people in Pisa during these two days, and I really enjoyed meeting them.</p>
