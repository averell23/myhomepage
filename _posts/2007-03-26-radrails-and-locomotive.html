<p>First day at work, and I finally figured out how to have <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a> to work together with the <a href="http://locomotive.raaum.org/">Locomotive</a> rails package for the Mac. </p>
<p>This really took me hours, because no matter how you configure RadRails with Locomotive, it will hate you. It won't recognise the rails commands, even if configured, and claim that it found none of the tools. I guess it's because it relies on some path settings from the environment, that are not accessible from the GUI. So you're stuck. Unless you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Locomotive</li>
<li>Open the Terminal from Locomotive, so that it has all the path settings</li>
<li>Start RadRails from the command line, like this:<br />
<code>open /Developer/Applications/radrails/RadRails.app</code>
</li>
</ul>
