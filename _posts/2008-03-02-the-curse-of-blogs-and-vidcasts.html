<p>It drives me crazy: Lot's of those projects, especially in the Rails world think it's a cool thing to have a "project" homepage that consists of a blog garnished with some video podcasts. But while this may look flashy, it's not an excuse for a complete absence of structure and documentation.</p>
<p>I have to admit that what put me over the top today was the <a href="http://www.datanoise.com/ruby-debug/">ruby-debug</a> "home page". It's really a great tool that I use daily, but each time I visit this page I'm on the edge.</p>
<p>First thing, it's a blog. I hate it. A blog is for <em>news</em>, but when I go to this page I want <em>documentation</em>. Yes, there is this <a href="http://datanoise.com/articles/2006/7/12/tutorial-on-ruby-debug">little tutorial</a>. If it's not accidentally linked from a post on the front page I have to dig through all the "ruby-debug" posts to find it. At least it explains all the commands in the debugger, but it doesn't go into the API to call the debugger from your code. </p>
<p>In the end, what would be so hard to put your documentation on a <em>static</em> page page that is linked from the <em>front</em> page? And maybe - behold - even add a link to the rdoc documentation that you can <em>automatically generate</em> from you code?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Instead (at the time I'm writing this), the top entry of the homepage is <a href="http://www.datanoise.com/articles/2007/5/10/ruby-debug-basics-screencast">this</a>. A link to a screencast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Brian Donovan shows the basics of using ruby-debug. This is very nice addition to my already outdated tutorial. He also announced that his next screencast will cover debugging of a Rails application.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A nice addition to the outdated tutorial? A nice addition would be an <em>updated</em> tutorial. But I disgress.</p>
<p>The point is I hate, hate, hate those screencasts. Well, not screencasts as such, but projects like <a href="http://streamlinedframework.org/">Streamlined</a> that don't even offer screenshots any more. You have to watch those fucking screencasts. </p>
<p>I know it's really exiting, like being on TV, and it's easy to - just wiggle your mouse a bit and talk into your mike. But do you <strong>honestly</strong> believe that I enjoy wasting just 10 minutes of my life to watch you guys typing into Texmate? I know that written documentation is hard to do. You need actual written communication skills (and here you have a chance to develop them). But all your cool mates would have a much easier time actually finding the information they're looking for.</p>
<p>Up to a point I believe that all those people are following the lead of the Rails homepage. It looks cool and has a vidcast. Did any of you guys notice that it lacks <strong>any</strong> structured introduction into the framework - except from those very basic tutorials that come from third parties? To get a comprehensive overview you have to shell out real bucks to buy the (admittedly good) book. </p>
<p>The thing is, they can get away with it. But unless you <em>have</em> a book <em>and</em> something that is cool enough to make folks out there actually buy it, please provide some structured documentation.</p>
