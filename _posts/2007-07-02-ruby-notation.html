<p>Ok, we all knew that Ruby is very dynamic. The fun part starts if you start thinking about your own notation. It turns out, it's even more loose and fast than I thought. So consider this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
obj = Klass.new</p>
<p>obj.do_something(params) # this calls the method with parameters<br />
obj::do_something(params) # this is actually the same thing (calls do_something)</p>
<p>obj.do_something:cool # and this call the method with the parameter :cool<br />
obj::do_something:cool # ok, and now it's getting funny</p>
<p>obj.Will_do # uppercase method names also work on objects</p>
<p># so, for classes</p>
<p>Klass.do_something # this will call the class method, of course<br />
Klass::do_something # and this also calls the method<br />
Klass.UpperCase # and this calls a class method with an upper case name<br />
Klass::UpperCase # BUT THIS CALLS THE CONSTANT (go, figure...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nice thing is that you can really start thinking of your own notation for things. Still, it's great weirdness notheless...</p>
