<p>I'm still in the middle of writing my thesis. Some lessons I have learned over the last few days, in no particular order:<br />
<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>The main reason not to update your schedule is because you'd realize you are never going to make it in time.</li>
<li>This is the same reason why most people don't have a schedule at all.</li>
<li>Open doors are nice for people who want to come in. They are not so nice if you don't want to be disturbed.</li>
<li>Shared offices promote communication, not concetration.</li>
</ul>
