<p>As a follow-up on <a href="http://www.gewinnt-immer.de/?p=84">this</a>, Nullriver has now <a href="http://www.nullriver.com/">officially declared</a> that Apple banned their application from the App store. The disturbing thing is this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We are seeing a lot of similar reports from various developers who's applications were abruptly removed and banned from the AppStore without any violations of the terms of service.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This behaviour (on part of Apple) is incredibly arrogant and unprofessional, and it discredits the platform for developers. Would you invest in the development of an app if you knew that someone else could later pull it off the market on a whim? </p>
<p>The most amazing thing is how they manage to pull this off - obviously the Mac fanboys are willing to go through anything...</p>
<p><strong>Edit: It continues:</strong> Apple also refuses applications for no other reason than <a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/2008/09/12/apple-bans-podcasting-app-from-app-store/">that they compete with iTunes</a>. It even stirred up some bad press. Apples solution: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/09/23/apple-extends-non-disclosure-to-app-store-rejection-letters/">Make the rejection letters confidential.</a></p>
<p><strong>And even more:</strong> Seems that <a href="http://angelo.dinardi.name/2008/09/20/mailwrangler-and-the-apple-app-store/">email clients aren't allowed either</a>. Oh, and not only do they want to have the last word on the App Store, but they'll also rescind your <a href="http://www.phonenews.com/apple-blocks-developers-from-bypassing-app-store-4695/">ability to distribute your application by other means</a>.</p>
