<p>
In addition to my last posting, here's something from the Dr. Dobbs Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest bone that the Java people have to pick with C# is not that the columnist Robert Cringely thinks it will run faster than Java, nor that it comes from Microsoft, nor even that it is a Java knock off. The real problem, about which very little is said, is that C# is a fixed-up knock off of the Java language: better scalars, proper properties, sensible facilities for event handling, a thought-out syntax for method overrides. Javans have been confronted by their own mortality. Could it be that the so-called language of the Internet is actually merely the voguish language of the .COMs?</p></blockquote>
