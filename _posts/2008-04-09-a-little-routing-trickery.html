<p>Documentation in Rails seems notoriously bad - the documentation appears to be painfully incomplete. Anyway, all the cool kiddies will tell you how to do resource routing; but I wanted a bit more. In particular, i wanted to have URLs that work like <tt>http://xxx/things//</tt>. Where  is the id of the thing you're watching, and  is an additonal identifier that is passed to the controller. For example, you could have a rout that let's you do <tt>http://xxx/cars/bug/green</tt>, to show you the green version of the bug.</p>
<p>After a little trial and error, I found that this will be possible using a route like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
map.resources :cars do |cars|
  cars.connect ':colour', :controller =&gt; 'cars',
    :action =&gt; 'car_with_colour'
end
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Which defines this in a much nicer fashion than matching the route "manually".</p>
