<p>All right. I give up. I have no idea, but maybe one of the hardcore coders has. I have been trying this to write an extension to ActiveRecord, so that I can have an active Record that has an <tt>uri</tt> field (it should transparently return URI objects when queried. So I did this:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
module ActiveRecord
  class Base

    # Adds the uri getter an setter to the current
    # class
    def self.has_uri_field(uri_type)

      # Initializer takes the uri field
      define_method("initialize") do |uri|
        super(nil) # &lt;--- NOTE THIS!
        write_attribute(:uri, uri.to_s)
      end

      ...
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, I use this to create a new ActiveRecord class with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
class SourceRecord &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_uri_field MyUriClass
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new class, the "initialize" method is dynamically overwritten with the method from the first code snippet. And now for the weirdness: I got to a point where I called
<pre>SourceRecord.new("uristring")</pre>
<p> and the new initializer gets executed. In turn, it  calls <tt>super</tt>, the <tt>ActiveRecord::Base</tt> initializer. Which, in turn, contains the following pice of code:</p>
<pre>result = yield self if block_given?</pre>
<p>The thing is that <tt>block_given?</tt> returns true and calls the <tt>Rails::Initializer.run</tt> block from environment.rb, passing an ActiveRecord as the config. Of course it fails miserably. </p>
<p>I have no idea where this block comes from. Inside the dynamically defined method it's not existent (methods created with define_method don't take blocks in 1.8). The stack trace is inconclusive. Of course the debugger fails to go there. At the moment I can work around with</p>
<pre>super(nil) { nil }</pre>
<p>which passes a useless block (which seems to work right), but the mystery remains.</p>
