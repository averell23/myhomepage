Just discovered <a href="http://www.photocase.de/">PhotoCase</a>, a kind of photo community thing. It appears that these are selected, high-quality photographs, suitable for print use. You get 3 downloads per day for free, or pay for more, making this an alternative for small publications when you can't afford the royalties of a professional agency.

Community-wise this appears to be a refreshing departure from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>-style "everyone uploads everything noone wants to see".
