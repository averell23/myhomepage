<p>Just a quick sef-reminder: Some Bluetooth applications on windows will only connect to a device through a virtual com port smaller than com9 or something. On the other hand, most bluetooth stacks seem to have to annoying habit to block a lot of com ports permanently if the adpater is plugged into different USB sockets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those COM ports never show up in Window's hardware manager, even if you enable the "Show hidden devices" option; so there's no way to unistall them.</p>
<p>At least there's a workaround, hidden deep inside the Microsoft knowledge base: <a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;315539">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;315539</a></p>
<blockquote><p>At a command prompt, type the following command , and then press ENTER:</p>
<p>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1</p>
<p>Type the following command a command prompt, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p>start devmgmt.msc</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember that you still have to enable the "Show hidden devices" option in the hardware manager to see the "ghost" devices.</p>
