<p>A few days ago I was browsing through Jeff Atwoods "Coding Horror" again. And this time he <a title="It has never been built before" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000727.html">missed the point in a very profound way</a>. To be fair, he falls for an all too common misconception: The belief that software engineering is very special and unlike every other kind of engineering.</p>
<p>Since the misconception is so common, he's easily able to back it up by quotes from some Sam Guckenheimer of Addison-Wesley fame. But that doesn't make it any more true.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that software engineering is very much like other engineering disciplines. There's nothing inherently special about it.</p>
