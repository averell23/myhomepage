<p>
Linked lists have been an integral part of programmers work. Now its time to annihilate this prehistoric data structure.</p>
<p>
Since early C days, you find linked list implementations in nearly every source file, most likely in its simplest form: A data structure with a 'next' pointer, refering to the node of the list, beeing such a data structure again.</p>
<p>
Then came object-orientation, and every class library provided at least one generic class for linked list, to the programmers don't need to implement a linked list themselves again. Brave new world. But, surprise, surprise - nobody used them.</p>
<p>
What the hell happened? Where had this most important of all data structures gone?</p>
<p>
Let's think about the reasons to use a linked list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linked lists are quite simple to program. </li>
<li>Insertion in a linked list is cheap: You can insert an element in O(1)</li>
<li>Concatenation of linked lists is cheap: You can put together two linked lists in O(1) (assumed that you have a double linked list), by setting the next-pointer of the last element of the first list to the head of the second list.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Good reasons, it seems. So why, why, why....?</p>
<p>
It's simple to explain: Compare this advantages with other data structures, let's say a self growing array:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every library provides such an array</li>
<li>Consecutive insertion in an self growing array is cheap: You can insert an element in O(2) - but you don't need to get new memory with "new" every time you insert an element</li>
<li>The concatenation of two lists is expensive, each element must be copied, so this is O(n).</li>
</ul>
<p>
So the advantage seems to be the concatenation of two lists. Isn't this sufficient to justify the existance of a generic linked list class in class library?</p>
<p>
Let's have a look at such a concatenation operation in O(1):</p>
<p>
Assume you have two lists, <em>l1</em> and <em>l2</em>. A new list is created by the concatenation of <em>l1</em> and <em>l2</em>, let's call this list <em>l3</em>. If you create <em>l3</em> the way described above, you will face a problem: The elements (nodes) in <em>l1</em> and <em>l2</em>&nbsp; are now as well in <em>l3</em>. But each node has only one next pointer. If you now change l3, you will as well change <em>l1</em> or <em>l2</em>. Since you have a <strong><em>generic</em></strong> linked list class, this is not desired behaviour. So you must create <em>l3</em> by copying the elments from<em> l1 </em>and <em>l3</em> to new nodes. This means, that you now do this operation in O(n).</p>
<p>
So now the last advantage of a linked list compared to an array has gone. Of course, there are a lot of cases, where the two operants of the concatenation are no longer used, and therefore, copying is not necessary. But - it should be a <strong><em>generic </em></strong>implementation, eh? And to be honest: How often do you need a concatenation operation?<em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p>
In short words: Nobody needs a generic linked list class, that has no advantages. You instead use an array - where you can access the entries simply by the index of the array in O(1).</p>
