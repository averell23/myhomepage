<p>Right in tune with my uneasyness about the whole Net 2.0 debate, I've found the "<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier06/lanier06_index.html">Digital Maoism</a>" essay by Jaron Lanier (a translation ran in the german SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung). It's well worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The beauty of the Internet is that it connects people. The value             is in the other people. If we start to believe that the Internet itself             is an entity that has something to say, we're devaluing those people             and making ourselves into idiots.</font></p></blockquote>
