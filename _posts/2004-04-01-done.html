<p>It's done, or at least almost. I printed out my thesis, which will now be bound and delivered to my prof. One more presentation and a demo, and I can call myself Diplominformatiker. Finally.</p>
<div>
The final phase consisted of two days of typical deadline frenzy, and right now I'm slowly returning to normal.  I guess this is the proper time to get a little sentimental, and finish the part that didn't make it into the thesis: Thanks to everyone who supported me.

Here we go: Thanks to my dad, who not only paid for the show, but did a lot of things that allowed me to get to where I am today. To Prof. Hanebeck and Fred for supervising the thesis (I hope they'll also come up with a good grade ;-). To Oli, Patrick, Didi and the other folks at the department for their creative input, and not minding to be told to shut up. To Uli, Betti and David for their proof-reading and comments. To all proof-readers for a lot of commas. In particular to Betti for the food, and to Uli for loads of C++ advice. To my brother for being around and sending me cool pictures.  To Gerhard and my other flatmates for tolerating me being sloppy with the cleaning and other stuff.<br />
To everyone for moral support and puttig up with me being more weird than usual. Is that all? I guess not, but if I figure I forgot someone I can always come back and re-edit.

The bottom line is this: I could have done it on my own, but it wouldn't have worked nearly as well.  When I saw other people finishing their thesis, I didn't think there was a need to be under a lot of stress.  Still, when it came to it, I was touchy.  In that situation I really appreciated those little gestures, even if I didn't always show it and even if it wasn't a big deal for the other person.

I hope you're all feeling warm and fuzzy inside now. I guess you deserve it.
