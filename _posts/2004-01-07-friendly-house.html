<p>When I was living in a student house in <a href="http://www.visitlancaster.co.uk/">Lancaster</a> for a while, my housemate  called it a "friendly house". I think this is one of the nicest things you can say about a place: That you'll be welcome, amongst friends and a little sheltered from the cruel world outside. A friendly place is about small things - a cup of tea, a glass of wine or somebody who remembers your birthday when nobody else does.  Most of all, a friendly place is about the people.<br />

This is general knowledge, of course, and I feel a little silly for stating the obvious and making it sound like there's a morale to it. There isn't, and there doesn't need to, but sometimes it's good to remind yourself that friendly places actually exist. You can go there and be welcome. </p>

I, for my part, will continue to try to be part of a friendly house whenever I can.
