<p>There we go again. Ruby has some, err... "unique" features when to the scope of variables. It really starts out really harmless, though...</p>
<p>This is part one of two - this one is just to give you a bit of background for the next one. There's not much surprising stuff there, so if you want to go for the stranger bits, <a href="http://www.gewinnt-immer.de/?p=58">just jump to the next installment</a>.</p>
