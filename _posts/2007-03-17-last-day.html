<p>Yesterday was the last day at the company, so I had to say goodbye to everybody. I had a little farewell "breakfast" going the day before; I received one of those little electronic translator thingies as a goodbye present. Everybody was really nice and wished me the best, too :-)</p>
<p>It was a bit strange. You go to work as usual in the morning, and then, in the evening you just leave for good...</p>
