<p>So now, seems that I only write in here when moving house or on such occasions. Which at least means that there is an update every now and then, and another occasion has arrived.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks Ingrid and I have been busy moving into our new home in the district of Mitte (which is, litterally, in the middle of Berlin). We're still quite amazed with the place, just a few minutes walk from the busy Alexander square, in a quiet zone just off the busiest streets and close to work for everyone. </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>In a nutshell, we're open for business; all the essential furniture in place, all the contracts signed and we're hoping that things will calm down for Christmas.</p>
<p>And now you know how to find us, too.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the next update (whenever that might be). Personally, I'm also going through the backlog of unanswered mail ;)</p>
