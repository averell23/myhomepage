<p>I tweaked the page a little more, most of the file downloads actually exist now, the role playing stuff is under an Open Content license and this news section has an RSS feed. I wonder if I'm ever going to update much - now that I have the possibility to quickly add content. My old page remained virtually untouched for years... time will show what will become of this one.</p>
