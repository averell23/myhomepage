<b>Update:</b> Patrick already put the <a href="http://www.seniorentanztee.de/akk04/index.html">pictures</a> up. We had a real crowd this time, and they were dancing until the early morning. Some were even girls ;-) Plus, we got backstage passes which entitled us to free food. <a href="http://www.seniorentanztee.de/akk04/CIMG0010.html">As you can see</a>, my <a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org/content/news/archives/000055.shtml">new glasses</a> have also arrived.

Just a reminder: Tonight the <a href="http://www.seniorentanztee.de/">Seniorentanztee- Crew</a> will be at the <a href="http://www.akk.org/sonder/sommerfest">AKK-Sommerfest</a>-Lounge. (from what I've heard, together with DJ vop from the <a href="http://www.fidelio-crew.de/">fidelio-crew</a>). See you there.
