<div>
I've now re-styled my page on <a href="http://www.gewinnt-immer.de/">www.gewinnt-immer.de</a> into a personal software developer's blog. Which means that, for those not interested in software development, this will be the only time the topic is touched here.
</div>
<div>
The new page has all the "blog features" missing from the old "new site", which should help the site getting actually read. (The Word Press software was also kind enough to annouce all posts to some kind of pinging service. While this got me some attention, I'm not so happy with it happening by default and without asking me...)
</div>
