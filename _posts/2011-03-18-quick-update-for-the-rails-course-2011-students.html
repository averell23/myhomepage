<p>As you may imagine, the Japan Earthquake and Tsunami has created a bit of work here at <a href="http://www.betterplace.org/campaigns/earthquake-japan">betterplace.org</a>, too. That means that I didn't get to post to the links to the resources quite as fast as I wanted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here's a quick update for my students.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
<p>The presentation is at <a href="http://prezi.com/cyt1mg2inxwd/ruby-course-march-2011/">http://prezi.com/cyt1mg2inxwd/ruby-course-march-2011/</a> - you will find the URLs of most interesting resources inside.</p>
<p><strong>Exam</strong></p>
<p>For the exam question, let me just say that it will be a Ruby (not Rails programming problem). You should be familiar with the basic data types in Ruby, how to convert data types, duck typing and the object-oriented features of the language, such as Mixins.</p>
