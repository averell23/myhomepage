<p>Fun how the internet can give you a first-hand look at what's going on in the world. Take our foreign minister to-be, Guido Westerwelle: You can find <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5zqt0Jr-Gg">this video</a> how he refuses to speak English to an British reporter at his press conference.</p>
<p>If you check the press, they will talk a lot about if he can speak the language or not. Conservative paper "Die Welt" talks about that he needs to <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/article4676540/Westerwelle-und-das-englische-Missverstaendnis.html">speak his mother tongue to get the nuances right</a>. I almost fell of my chair.</p>
<p>Get it straight: The problem isn't that he refused to speak English. The problem is that he couldn't refuse without looking like an arse and, above all, that he was <em>completely unable</em> to answer a simple question, even in his mother tongue.</p>
<p>Please Guido, grow up. Until now, here in Italy, these little videos were always about Silvio. But watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bPqaqGJ5Js">this video of Berlusconi</a>, where he insults the German MP Schulz and the entire European parliament, and compare it. This was one of the most outrageous moments of his career (well, one of many). But at least, while coughing up all this horseshit, he manages to not appear lobotomized. Sigh.</p>
