<div>
The "Seilerei" is (from what I've heard) a quite good restaurant in Karlsruhe. I've not been there, but as far as I've seen from passing by, they even have a nice interior. Now I've found they also have <a href="http://www.restaurant-seilerei.de/">one of the worst web sites imaginable</a>, complete with ugly photos.
</div>
<div>
Even worse, they obviously paid someone for the hideous thing. How can one actually go and pay a web agency who's not even able to come up with a <a href="http://www.dv-marketing.de/">decent web site themselves?</a> (Oh, and take a look at the comments on that page. I've not figured out if they're all ironic, or if the people <i>really</i> think the site is beautiful...)
