<p>
Since some say that <a href="http://osl.iu.edu/~tveldhui/papers/techniques/techniques01.html#l12">virtual method calls</a> are evil, I ran some tests to check how much overhead they create in C#.</p>
<p>
Unchecked result: They are about 5 times slower than nonvirtual calls. However, before you get overly excited: On my machine I could still make 5 Million virtual calls in 0.04 milliseconds.</p>
<p>
I guess in most cases the time spent in virtual calls will still be insignificant.</p>
<p>
<strong>Addendum, for those who shy away from indirections:</strong> There's no measurable penalty for nonvirtual calls (compared to inline code)</p>
