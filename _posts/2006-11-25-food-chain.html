<p>The "Canned Platypus" blog came up with a <a href="http://pl.atyp.us/wordpress/?p=1160">food chain of programmers</a>. I could go into a longish rant about why it doesn't make much sense. But I leave that as an excercise to my readers.</p>
<p>I think each programmer will have her or his own opinion about that.</p>
