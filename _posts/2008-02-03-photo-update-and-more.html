<p>So, it's a while since I posted something here and it's about time for the first news in this year...</p>
<div class="sideitem">
<img style="float:right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smile.jpg" alt="Smile" />
</div>
<p>I finally got to sort my digital photo collection and actually put some new ones <a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org/photos/fb.php?p=image/archives/1/">into the gallery</a>. Now I have to check for a digital print service here in Pisa, to get some on the walls too.</p>
<p>My DSL adventure actually went into a second round as the line deteriorated after a few weeks. It took some phoning with the customer service, and they had to change the lines, but everything seems fine now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, work is going on and I'm still changing between Trento and Pisa. Christmas was a major travelfest, but now things should get a bit quieter until, let's say, Easter :-) </p>
<p>The Italian is slowly improving, but I hope I can have another course in order to get to the finer points.</p>
