The <a href="http://www.spreadshirt.net/">Spreadshirt</a> web shop (which is the online T-Shirt printing service, where the <a href="http://www.seniorentanztee.de/shop.html">Seniorentanztee shop</a> is hosted) is <a href="http://olp.spreadshirt.net/wordpress/">looking for a new corporate identity.</a>

This reminds me of the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/International_logo_vote/Finalists">Wikipedia logo contest</a>. I guess this was supposed to be a grass-democratic Web 2.0 type thingie. But take a look at the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/International_logo_vote/Finalists">finalist entries</a>. And then see the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Nohat-Wiki-logo-2.png">crappy logo</a> that was actually chosen. The only nice thing about is it that is probably the one that makes the greatest number of people only slightly unhappy. <strike>Wow, I'm so underwhelmed.</strike> (I take that back. I'm not underwhelmed. I think the Wikipedia logo is an abomination.)

The Spreadshirt "open" contest may actually work for the sole reason that there won't be a public election of the winner. Spreadshirt will select a design for themselves, and I bet it won't be something like <a href="http://olp.spreadshirt.net/wordpress/?p=335">this (yuk!).</a>
</div>
<div>
The whole point is: Design is <b>not</b> a democratic process. Taste cannot be decided upon by majority votes. It's an individualistic thing, both in the making and in use.
