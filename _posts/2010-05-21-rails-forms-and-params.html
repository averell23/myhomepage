<p>Another not to self: Rails has the cool feature that you it will map all the values from your submitted forms into the <code>params</code> hash. And, if you create input fields that are named "<code>something[bla]</code>", it will automatically create a nested hash so that you will be able to access <code>params[:thingyform][:something]</code>.</p>
<p>But what if you just have a list of things that you need to submit? In this case, just name multiple form fields <code>something[]</code>, and the <code>params</code> will contain an array.</p>
