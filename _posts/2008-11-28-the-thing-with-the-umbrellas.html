<p>There is something particular about Pisa. I don't think it's even an Italian thing, just something particular about this city.</p>
<p>When it rains people use umbrellas on their bicycles. They're driving around, guiding the bike with one hand and holding the umbrella in the other. Of course it doesn't get very fast that way, but it seems to be an accepted way of moving around...</p>
