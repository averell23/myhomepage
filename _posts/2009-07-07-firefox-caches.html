<p>Note to self: Pressing the reload button in Firefox causes the browser to <em>always</em> connect to the server, even for cached items that are still valid. It will, however, only check if the resource is still valid, accepting the "304 not changed" response.</p>
<p>Clicking normally will not connect to the server, while shift+reload will force a re-download in all cases. </p>
