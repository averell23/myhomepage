<div>
I officially moved in with Ingrid. Well, this ain't exactly breaking news for most of you, but I don't get to post here much lately. And now that the furniture is all in place, the boards are on the wall and the computer is online, I wanted to give everyone a little update ;-)
</div>
<p><!--more--></p>
<div>
What changed? First of all, my adress. Here's what you need to know:</p>
<p>
<i><br />
Daniel Hahn<br />
Lessingstr. 70<br />
76135 Karlsruhe<br />
Germany<br />
</i></p>
<p>Everything else remains the same. And yes, this includes my land line phone number! (Although I still didn't connect the answering machine. I get caller ID's though ;-)
</p></div>
<div>
What else? </p>
<ul>
<li>In the process of moving I got rid of about one cubic metre of old stuff. What a relief.</li>
<li>I've got a really nice room now, with a nice view of Karlsruhe (well, a part of it...). I should post some photo here, but I'd have install some software first.</li>
<li>Speaking of which, I should also update my blogging sofware, which doesn't appear to be spam-safe in the least.</li>
<li>We had broadband connection installed to the flat. This means that, in the evening you should be able to catch me on Jabber, or on Skype (the screen name is <i>averell23</i>, by the way).</li>
<li>I always seem to have a large backlog of things to do, which ranges from playing WoW to catching up with people.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the news for today, good night and take care everyone.
</p></div>
