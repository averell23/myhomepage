<p>I'm currently hunting for a new Ruby/Rails IDE, after spending a while on VisualStudio with Windows.</p>
<p>I've already gone through a list of tools: Starting with <a href="http://www.nedit.org/">nEdit</a> for my first university projects, my long-time favourite <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>, <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/">KDevelop</a> and, of course, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">VisualStudio</a>.</p>
<p>And the long and short is this: The central part of the experience is the editor and the navigation. If this doesn't work, you can throw the rest out. And for this central part, there are the small things that really make the difference.</p>
