<p>All, right I give up: I have moved the new section to <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org/">MoveableType</a>. I'd really have preferred something truely Open Source, but it gives me more freedom than I had with the old <a href="http://noahgrey.com/greysoft/">Greymatter</a>. It also allowed me to import my old entries, so there shouldn't be any disruption - and previewing comments works properly now. Besides that, I haven't added any fancy features so far, just the very basic stuff.</p>
