<p>Last week I needed a quick way to monitor our server, and also updated our code documentation. I've come up with some small tools that some people out there may find useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/averell23/gokdok">gokdok</a> - automatically upload your rdoc documentation as <a href="http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages">github-pages</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.github.com/averell23/watchdogger">watchdogger</a> - a little watchdog daemon that's quite configurable</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The gokdok thing addresses fact that github offers you a space for project pages, but in no way helps you to build your documentation or upload it. It's just a small rake task, but it works fine for me (and we finally have fresh rdocs online again...)</p>
<p>The watchdog was made to monitor our instance of Tomcat. At the moment it does exactly what I need it to do, which is monitoring some web pages and the log file and killing the server process in case of trouble. It should be very easy to extend. </p>
