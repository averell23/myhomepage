<p>For some reason, <code>return </code>statements are outlawed in our shop. The official reason given is that you'd always need a place to "clean up things", which is not guaranteed when you use <i>return</i>. Personally, I think that's a bit far-fetched, but whatever.</p>
<p>However, to keep things a bit more readable, something called the "for-bool-loop" has been established. The ingenious snippet works like this:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><code><br />
for(bool bCond = true; bCond; bCond = false)<br />
{<br />
   do_something();<br />
   if(!success) {<br />
      set_error();<br />
      break;<br />
   }<br />
   do_something_else();<br />
}<br />
</code></p>
<p>I personally consider this to be, er, a bit bizarre. In most cases, <i>return</i>s would have been perfectly acceptable instead of this <i>goto</i> in disguise. I'm perfectly happy with returning or breaking (even goto) where it makes sense; but this thing seems somewhat gross.</p>
<p>Anyway, what's your opinion on this?</p>
