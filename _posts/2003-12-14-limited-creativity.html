<p>I've only waited and now it's there: my new domain, <a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org">limitedcreativity.org</a>.  This was my idea for our server hosting domain, which now resides at <a href="http://community.newgods.org/">newgods.org</a> and since it was still free I grabbed it. </p>
<p>It's still just an redirect to my "normal" page, since I'd have to reset all Moveable type path entries to move to that domain properly...</p>
