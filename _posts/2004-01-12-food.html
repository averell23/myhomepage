<p>Prompted by <a href="http://www.newgods.org/~yashima/dd/the_naked_chef.html">Sonja's entry</a> I also ordered another <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.net/">Jamie Oliver</a> book. I saw the show only once, but I like the recipes: No frills. I like a good meal with fresh ingredients, I love herbs, but I'm really a lazy guy and I usually try to avoid all this fancy stuff that turns a simple meal into a full-scale engineering effort.<br />

It'd be interesting to classify people by their cooking behaviour: For many students, cooking is just about mixing ingredients together and adding heat. Fresh ingrendients are rare, and everything is deliberately simple. Their token recipe is the infamous tomato pulp. It wil always contain onions.

The grand chef, on the other hand, tries to impress his friends with an intimidating array of pans and recipes like a sushi of glazed  bat fillets, on a bed of steamed baby asparagus. Although the food is often excellent, there is a real danger of starving to death while it is being prepared. The traditionalist will follow the recipes of her elders to the letter, while the progressive cook likes to experiment.  Gizmo-masters will fill their kitchen with special toys for every purpose,  the purists make do with a single knife and a pan. There's also the age-old animosity between those who use recipe books and those who reject them.

When you look around you'll notice that there are special recipe books for each of these interest groups. I still opt for the (Naked Chef-like) attitude that you can throw away half of the normal cooking riff-raff without sacrificing taste or quality.
