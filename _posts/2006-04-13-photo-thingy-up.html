<p>I finally found some time to putÂ  a <a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org/photos/fb.php">photo section</a> on my page. There isn't much content yet, but I'll try to put up some new ones from time to time. The images will be specially cropped for web presentation, so they're different from the prints I have made, which are still different from the "original" image.</p>
<p>There's also an RSS feed, though I haven't put a direct link on the page yet.</p>
