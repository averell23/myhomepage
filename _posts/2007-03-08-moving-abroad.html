<p>As many of you know, I've quit my job at <a href="http://www.funkinform.de/">Funkinform</a> here in Germany, and will move to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa">Pisa</a>, Italy, by the end of March. <a href="http://bec.science.unitn.it/infm-bec/people/bausmerth.html">Ingrid</a> is currently doing her Ph.D. in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento">Trento</a>, so it's likely that I'll spend quite some time in that place, too ;-)</p>
<p>From April on, I'll be employed by <a href="http://www.netseven.it/">Net7</a> in Pisa, and work on the EU-funded <a href="http://www.discovery-project.eu/">Discovery</a> project. I guess my new tasks will be challenging and fun. Check the project home page to see what it's all about.</p>
<p>For me it will be developing a new version of the Hyper web software, to be written in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. Since this will be an open-source project, I'll probably tell you more of the development on my <a href="http://www.gewinnt-immer.de/">tech blog</a>.</p>
<p>I'll also try to keep this site updated with news on how my new life in Italy is going - so it may get a bit more exciting here. </p>
<p>You'll still be able to catch me in Karlsruhe until the 17th. At that date I'll load all my belongings onto a big truck, and drive it down to Pisa. After that, you'll have to visit Tuscany to see me ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.limitedcreativity.org/downloads/Pisamove.kmz">Here</a> are all the coordinates for <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>, just to let you have a preview of my new location. My new apartment will be conveniently located near <a href="http://www.pisa-airport.com/">Galileo Galilei  airport</a>, which means you'll be able to get discount flights from lots of locations.</p>
