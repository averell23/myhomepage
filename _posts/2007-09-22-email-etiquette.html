<p>I kind of stumbled onto a <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/01/microsoft_takes_email_design_b.html">discussion about HTML email formatting</a>. Obviously Microsoft has chosen to use a crappier rendering engine in the new versions of Outlook. How touching.</p>
<p>Fact is, <em>completely disabling</em> the HTML rendering is one of the first things I do when setting up my email client. One thing is that it takes the air out of 99% of all the phishing/spam/trojan/whatever mails you receive.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, to this date I have <strong>never ever</strong> received an email that added any significant value to the content by using HTML. Really, there are only two uses I've ever seen: a) "Cool" Outlook templates used by hapless people and b) marketing mail made posher by HTML.</p>
<p>Now, I don't mind anyone sending me pimped email, as long as they have the courtesy to include a readable plain-text version. It shouldn't be too hard, really.</p>
<p>Worst offender so far: The "social networking" people from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. Every single email from them looks like this to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>This message contains a rich-text HTML portion. Consult your mail client's documentation for infomation on how to view it.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course it contains only <em>one single sentence and a hyperlink</em>. Close second is actually <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> - their text-only version is a convoluted mess. But to be honest even the HTML versions of their things tend to be badly laid out and nearly unreadable.</p>
<p>Last candidate on today's list of email offenders is Hotspot company <a href="http://www.thecloud.de/">The Cloud</a>. After using one of their WiFi hotspots, they are hell-bent on sending me their newsletter. They <em>did</em> include a plain text version - what they didn't do is to provide any information on <strong>why</strong> they're sending me their stuff or <strong>how</strong> to unsubscribe.</p>
<p>Email communication is quite essential in today's business world. And people <strong>hate</strong> dealing with crap in their inbox, simply because there's so much of it. </p>
<p>So it's even more stunning that there are companies out there who still don't know the most basic of rules.</p>
