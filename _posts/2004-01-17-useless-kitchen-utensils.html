<p>Have you ever noticed that the kitchen is one of the places where you accumulate loads of those silly dust catchers? Most of them are actually useful for <i>something</i>, but if you look at them you wonder why you haven't used them in two years. Of course, the one you don't have is the one you'll sorely miss. Here's a small collection, in no particular order:<br />
<!--more--><br />
The pressure cooker: My pet peeve. Some people love it, I think it's only good for cooking potatoes and I don't eat potatoes very often. Microwave oven: No use except warming things up and exploding hamsters. How cool. Machine to vacuum-pack stuff in plastic bags: The best thing about it is that it doesn't actually work. Electric appliances like can openers, carving knifes or bread cutters: No matter how easy the task, someone will come up with an electrical machine that will be bulky, loud and awkward to use. You can actually cut  bread with a knife, you know? Non-stick pan and friends: They'd actually be quite useful, if the non-stick coating stuck to the pan. It doesn't, and you aren't supposed to use them on high heat either. Plus I never ever had problems cleaning a steel pan. Fryer: It's the only proper way to fry. And you cook fried food every day, don't you? Ceran stove: Looks cool. Looks  less cool when damaged by your carelessness. Expensive to replace when it doesn't look cool any more. Devices to slice eggs or cheese or dice onions: Oh my. If you need to, get a kitchen machine. Patrick says they break. Dull knives: How dull.</p>
