<p>I my ongoing quest to learn more Rails, I tried to do some (more or less) fancy AJAX stuff. And even though Rails afficinados claim "seamless" support, AJAX is a pile of hacks. Rails at least makes it a bit less painful.</p>
<p>In any case, there are some resources that can help you to get along:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=5142#5142">Handy RJS tips</a>, that show you how to use the syntax</li>
<li>Or get to the basics: <a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/seven-togglers/">Toggling elements with Javascript</a></li>
<li>If you get to play with Rails more, you may want to <a href="http://blog.lathi.net/articles/2006/03/31/testing-rails-helpers">test your helpers</a>.</li>
<li>There's are also some things about the in-place-editor (<a href="http://heurionconsulting.wordpress.com/2007/05/23/in-place-editing-with-rjs/">Article 1</a>) (<a href="http://rubythis.blogspot.com/2006/11/using-rails-inplaceeditor-and.html">Article 2</a>).
</li>
<li>How to include <a href="http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/509">a custom CSS for each controller and/or action</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the in-place-editing gets a bit more involved once you want to edit more than one object on the page...</p>
