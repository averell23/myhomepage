<p>I while ago I wrote a small ruby library for runtime assertions to use in our projects. While I didn't use it as heavily as expected, it has been useful in debugging in the beginning. It offers the possibility to include extra runtime checks - even expensive ones - to the code, which can be disabled in production code. </p>
<p>I've <a href="http://github.com/averell23/assit/">moved the project to github</a> now, and the gem is not broken anymore. This means that you can</p>
<blockquote><p>
sudo gem install averell23-assit
</p></blockquote>
<p>from <a href="http://gems.github.com/">gems.github.com</a>. The old gem (assit) is still around on rubyforge for some reason, but it'll remain on 0.0.3 forever. If you use this, better get the github version (averell23-assit) now.</p>
