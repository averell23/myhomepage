<p>In my quest for the perfect project management tool, I tested out <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence">Mingle</a> (if you want to see all those features, just browse their site).</p>
<p>It's a really flexible tool and with the new version it's really getting close to what we'd need. They got some fresh ideas, a flexible tool and lots of eye-candy. It was even easy to set up. I'd try it for real, if it weren't for those few big gripes...</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>All the eye-candy is really hard on the browser. On Safari it seemed quite snappy, but Firexfox paused regularly... and that is on a recent Core2Duo machine.</li>
<li>It still seems to need work. I can reproduce an error just by creating a project from a default template and trying to add a new card.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle/2.0/help/system_requirements.html">system requirements</a> are ridiculous. The kindly ask you to have a 2Ghz server with 2GB ram. Dedicated to running a single web app.  There are 3D shooters that get away with less.</li>
<li>Take a look at the  <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence/pricing-and-license">pricing</a>: Sure, you get the first 5 licenses for free and they give it away for free for open source projects.
<p>But beyond that, it's about $1000 bucks <em>per user</em>. So a small shop with 20 users would have to shell out $15,000 for licenses. Or rent the thing for over  $4000 <em>per year</em>.</p>
<p>For a comparison, Atlassian Jira <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing.jsp">starts from $1,200</a> for a <em>server</em> license.  Even Joel Spolsky's (equally hype-driven) <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/">FogBugz</a> only sets you off $199 per user... I'm not even going to talk about free tools here.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum it up: It seems to be a really good software and I'm sure they'll iron out the technical problems. </p>
<p>But marketing-wise it seems to be aimed exclusively at venture-capital driven companies, who can't otherwise figure out how to to burn their cash. At least I imagine that these are the people who can't wait buy a new server and hand out huge amounts of cash for a tool that's still suffering from teething problems.</p>
<p>Because, hey, it looks cool. And it's <em>WRITTEN IN RAILS</em> (oooooooooh-yeah!) and it's <em>AGILE</em> (oooooh-hooooo) and it has ThoughtWorks written on the outside, so all the cool kids must have it.</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
