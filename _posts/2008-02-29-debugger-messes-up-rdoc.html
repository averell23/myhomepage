<p>Sometimes it seems that ruby still has a way to go in terms of maturity. Today I got a strange error message when trying to build the rdoc files:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code><br />
uninitialized constant RubyToken::AlreadyDefinedToken (NameError)<br />
</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any idea what it means? It turns out that I forgot to remove a <tt>require 'ruby-debug'</tt> somewhere in the code, which in turn includes some files from irb, which in turn is <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/141941">incompatible with rdoc</a>. Duh...</p>
