Last thursday we've been to <a href="http://www.nilslandgren.com/">Nils Landgren</a> and the Funky unit, currently on their <a href="http://www.actmusic.com/act9430.htm">Funky Abba</a> tour.
</div>
<div>
The music was much more funky (and less Abba-like) than I expected; though you can still recognise those old songs. And while I happen to like Abba, this music can get you going even if you aren't too fond of swedish pop history.

The house was completely crammed, and the crowd was raving. It was a fun time, and I bought the CD.

The bad new for you is that the <a href="http://www.nilslandgren.com/tour_news.html">tour is over</a> for now. The CD is still available, though, and you can even <a href="http://www.actmusic.com/act9430.htm">listen to the samples</a> on the net.
