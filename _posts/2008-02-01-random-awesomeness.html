<p>Usually I'm not such a big fan of "shareware" products and the like - too often you get charged for crap that is outclassed by the free alternatives. Plus, I didn't had good experiences with the "customer support" of independent vendors in the past.</p>
<p>That said, there are some tools that are really worth their price, like <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>. And a while ago I bought <a href="http://1passwd.com/">1password</a> (1passwd before...), because I wanted to share my web passwords between all browsers (and Firefox doesn't support the Mac keychain). It worked as advertised, giving something like a "single-sign-on" from any browser. Also, with the built-in password generator I don't use the same default password for all sites any more. It also synchronises to the iPhone/iPod touch (and also with a Palm device, if you pay a little extra). </p>
<p>But the really amazing thing is that the new beta can automatically <a href="http://switchersblog.com/2008/01/30/safari-autofill-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch-1.html">fill in forms on your iPhone/iPod touch</a>. Way cool, it just synchronises a "bookmarklet" to the device, it's all javascript and you don't have to install and hack anything. And on the Apple mobile devices that is worth gold, since they <em>still</em> don't have copy-and-paste...</p>
<p>And I can finally log in to password-protected sites on the go.</p>
