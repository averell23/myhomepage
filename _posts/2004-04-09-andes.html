<p>This weeks book recommendation is "Death in the Andes" (Tod in den Anden) by Vargas Llosa. I liked that book. It was good. Note that "good" doesn't always equal "well written" or "exciting".</p>
<div>
A good book is in some ways the opposite of the kind of literature (think Steven King) which is exciting, well-written and a complete waste of time. I guess good books are about people, not about things that happen to people.  Llosa tells us a story about people by describing what they do to each other.  Which is, in some ways, scarier than Steven King.

It's up to you to find out what the book is actually about. I'll only say that Llosa describes humans, stuck in an hostile environment and surrounded by forces they don't understand.
