<p>For the new year, I upgraded to a new machine which includes MacOS Leopard. The system looks o.k., a few nice features and not much changed really. However, there are also some annoyances:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Leopard includes a Rails distribution, but to move up to 2.0 you should do</p>
<pre>
<code>
gem update --system
gem update
</code>
</pre>
<p>to get the newest version of everything. Gem works out of the box, but uses a slightly unusual directory layout. Which means that Netbeans 6.0 will not enable the "Fast Debugger" (which is ruby-debug) - <strong>even</strong> if you installed ruby-debug-(ide|base|}-* and all the rest. The solution is a bit hidden on the NetBeans pages:</p>
<p>Add the following to <code>/Applications/NetBeans/NetBeans 6.0.app/Contents/MacOS/netbeans</code></p>
<pre><code>
export GEM_PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8:/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8
export GEM_HOME=/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8
</code></pre>
<p>This will set the environment variables that NetBeans needs to find the Gems - after the next scan it will re-scan the gem directories, and you can start using the debugger...</p>
