<p>We were shopping for clothes this weekend. In one shop they were constantly playing ads for ringtones for your mobile, which was annoying, and I wondered why any sane shopkeeper would do that. The theory goes that they're playing MTV, which is totally relying on ringtones-through-sms nowadays. In any case, it's worse than muzak.</p>
