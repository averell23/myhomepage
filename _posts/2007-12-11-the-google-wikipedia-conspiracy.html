<p>From a press site I found a link to a quite <a href="http://www.iicm.tugraz.at/iicm_papers/dangers_google.pdf">bizarre paper</a> (actually a collection of papers - you can also check the <a href="http://www.iicm.tugraz.at/iicm_papers/">publication list</a> of those people) about the "dangers and opportunities" of Google. Which wouldn't be a bad thing - there's a lot of real dangers to Google's data-collection mania.</p>
<p>But instead of a scientifically sound study, we get something of a weird conspiracy theory, involving Google, Wikipedia and, eventually, world domination.</p>
<p>Let me say that I didn't actually read the whole 187-page pamphlet, so I might miss some important point... but let me just quote the introduction:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Plagiarism and IPR violation are serious concerns in academia and in the commercial world </li>
<li>Current techniques to fight both are rudimentary, yet could be improved by a concentrated  initiative</li>
<li>One reason why the fight is difficult is the dominance of Google as THE major search engine  and that Google is unwilling to cooperate</li>
<li>The monopolistic behaviour of Google is also threatening how we see the world, how we as  individuals are seen (complete loss of privacy) and is threatening even world economy (!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
