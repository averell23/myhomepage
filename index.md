# Where to find things

As most of the time I don't have time to write longer texts, the
"blog" portion of this page will rarely be updated; and if it
is the content will be mirrored on Medium as well.

## Professional Stuff

* [LinkdIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-hahn-2b636215) and
  [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Daniel_Hahn8)
  have all you need to know about my professional experience.
* [My github profile](https://github.com/averell23/) shows which projects I
  have worked on.

## Written Stuff

* Short musings will be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/averell23),
  Google Plus and such will receive a copy.
* Longer texts will still be published here, and be available on Medium as well.
* You will still find all my old writings here, minus the crossposts from Twitter.

## Photography

* My [Instagram Profile](https://www.instagram.com/averell23/)
  will have the pictures of the day.
* My [photography site](http://photography.danielhahn.io) has more or my images
  on various topics
